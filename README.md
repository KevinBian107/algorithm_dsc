# algorithm_dsc
This repository is for demnonstrating fundamental algorithms that is essential to practices in data science and machine learning
Algorithm include areas of:
1. Fundamental Search ALgorithm (UCSD DSC20, DSC30, DSC40B)
2. Graph Search Algorithm (UCSD DSC40B)
3. Language Models (UCSD DSC80)
4. Learning Algorithms?
5. ...

***Demonstrating DS skills learned from multiple DSC classes***

# Todo:
1. Create branches for development
2. Add Models:
   - Add Ngram Langauge Model Algorithm
   - Add Kruska's Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Trees, and other Graph Search Algorithm
4. Add Visulization & Instruction for each of the algorithm/models
5. Modularization of each Algorithm
6. PAcking into a distributable packages for distribution
