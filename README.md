# algorithm_dsc
This repository is for demnonstrating fundamental algorithms that is essential to practices in data science and machine learning

# Todo:
1. Create branches for development
2. Add Models:
   - Add Ngram Langauge Model Algorithm
   - Add Kruska's Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Trees, and other Graph Search Algorithm
4. Add Visulization & Instruction for each of the algorithm/models
